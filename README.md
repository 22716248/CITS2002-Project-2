# CITS2002-Project-2
Systems Programming Project 2

The goal of this project is to write a command-line utility program in C99, named mergetars, which merges the contents of multiple tar archive files into a single tar archive file.
 
Successful completion of the project will develop your understanding of advanced features of the C99 programming language, and many useful Linux operating system system-calls and POSIX function calls.
